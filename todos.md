# Todos

## Make it usable with multi grid and better persistence

### Multi grid

- [ ] allow saving multiple grids
- [ ] list saved grids on home page
- [ ] delete grid

#### Sync

- [ ] auto paginate primary column
- [ ] When opening the grid, re-sync the primary column

## Improve columns & column types

Logic surrounding column types is scattered throughout the codebase. Let's consolidate each column type into a single file that has the logic for prompting, display, filtering, sorting, etc.

- [ ] Column sort
- [ ] Column filter
- [ ] Column edit
- [ ] Column type: file list
- [ ] Column type: user file

## Done

- [x] add group by button
- [x] column delete
- [x] refactor column types to be more organized
